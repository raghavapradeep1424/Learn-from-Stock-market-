	Here are summary points from a stock market video. Please expand them and structure the explanation into well-divided topics:
		1. Geopolitical/Global Market News
		2. Indian Market Technicals/Trends
		3. Regulatory & SEBI Actions
		4. Company-Specific Events (with sentiment noted)
		5. IPOs/Bonus Updates
		6. New Contracts/Orders
For each event, explain it clearly and in full detail. Mention sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and affected companies. Avoid tables.
